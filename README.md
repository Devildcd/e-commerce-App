# E-commerce App (Angular 20)

Small e-commerce frontend built with Angular 20 using a feature-based architecture, standalone components, and Signal Stores. The backend is simulated using Fake Store API.

**Fake API:** <https://fakestoreapi.com/>

> **Note:** Auth is simulated and handled via a modal (there is no /login route). Protected routes redirect back to `/` and can optionally preserve a `returnUrl` query param.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Catalog with

* products fetch from Fake Store API
* category filtering
* search term filtering
* pagination (client-side)
* Product detail route (lazy-loaded)

### Cart

* add/remove items
* update quantities
* totals (items + amount)
* cart dropdown (scrollable list + sticky subtotal/actions)

### Checkout

* shipping + payment forms (simulated payment)
* processing spinner during payment simulation
* optional “pending changes” protection via `canDeactivate`

### Global UX

* sticky header
* notifications/toasts (auto-dismiss)
* logging service (dev-friendly)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Angular 20 (standalone + modern template control flow `@if`, `@for`)
* `@ngrx/signals` (Signal Store pattern for state)
* TailwindCSS + a bit of SCSS where needed
* HTTP interceptors (global error normalization + notifications)
* Guards: `canActivate`, `canMatch`, `canDeactivate`

## 📂 Project Structure

The app is split by features, with shared UI and a small core layer for cross-cutting concerns.

src/app/
  core/
    errors/        # Global error handler
    guards/        # Route guards (auth, cart-not-empty, canDeactivate, etc.)
    interceptors/  # HTTP interceptors (e.g. httpErrorInterceptor)
    models/        # Domain models (Product, CartItem, etc.)
    services/      # Infrastructure services (API clients, logging, notifications)
    state/         # App-wide stores when needed (UiStore, etc.)
    utils/         # Helpers

  features/
    auth/          # Auth feature (modal-based login)
    cart/          # Cart feature (pages, components)
    catalog/       # Catalog feature (pages, components)
    checkout/      # Checkout feature (pages, services)

  layout/
    main-layout/   # Main layout shell (header, router outlet, footer)

  shared/
    components/    # Reusable components (footer, header pieces, etc.)
    directives/    # Reusable directives
    interfaces/    # Shared types/contracts
    pipes/         # Pipes (e.g. shortDescription)
    ui/            # UI primitives (spinner, etc.)

## 🧩 Architecture Notes

* **Flow:** `UI components/pages` → `Stores` → `Services/API`
* Pages/components do not call `HttpClient` directly.
* Services deal with HTTP, mapping, and infrastructure concerns.
* This keeps the UI clean and avoids “smart templates”.

---

## 🧭 Routing

* Routes are lazy-loaded per feature. Sensitive routes are protected:
  * `/cart` → requires auth
  * `/checkout` → requires auth + cart not empty
* Checkout uses `canDeactivate` to prevent leaving during processing / pending progress.
* Because login is modal-based, guards redirect to `/` and can push a notification like “Please login to continue”.

## 🏃 Running Locally

1. `npm install`
2. `ng serve`

Then open <http://localhost:4200>.

---

## ⚙️ Environment / Assets

* Static assets are served from `public/` (Angular modern approach).
* Components use modern Angular metadata (`styleUrl`).

---

## 📌 What’s Next (Planned)

* Unit tests / component tests (not added yet)
